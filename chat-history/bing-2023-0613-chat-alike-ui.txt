Search the web, then suggest several frontend templates to display texts as chat-alike.

Great! Now I also expect that some chats could be collapsed, and user can jump to specified chat via search or index.

Great! I have some markdown files which contain the chats, how could I use these markdown files as inputs or external resources, then render them to chat-alike UI?

Great! I have json files which contain the chats, how could I use these json files as inputs or external resources, then render them to chat-alike UI?

Fine. Then in latex beamer, is there a method to display markdown in a scrollable box?

How to collapse and expand a part of the text in latex beamer?


OK, I would like to use reveal.js to present the chats, how to do that?

Please search the web, then provide an example to present the chat texts in markdown format in reveal.js.

Suppose I have a markdown file named "chat.md", how to render this markdown file in reveal.js.
Please provide full code example.
