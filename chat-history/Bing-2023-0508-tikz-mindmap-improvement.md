> The contents in trippple backticks are example codes which include graphics in beamer frame.  Please adjust the width and height options to make it fit and fill the frame, without exceed the page limit or cropped:

>   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{tikz-lessons-mindmap.pdf}

You can adjust the width and height options of the `\includegraphics` command to make the image fit and fill the frame without exceeding the page limit or being cropped. Here’s an example of how you can do this:

    \begin{frame}{Lessons Mindmap}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{tikz-lessons-mindmap.pdf}
    \end{frame}
    

In this example, I’ve set the `height` option to `0.8\textheight` to leave some space for the frame title. You can adjust this value as needed to fit your specific needs.

> Remove the level-2 children nodes from the original tikz codes

Here is the modified version of the original TikZ code with the level-2 children nodes removed:

    \documentclass{standalone}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{positioning}
    \usetikzlibrary{mindmap,trees}
    \usepackage{verbatim}
    
    \begin{document}
    \pagestyle{empty}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[mindmap, grow cyclic, every node/.style=concept, concept color=black, text=white,
      level 1/.append style={level distance=5cm, sibling angle=360/\the\tikznumberofchildren},
      level 2/.append style={level distance=3cm, sibling angle=45},
    ]
    
      \node {GPT Survey: A programmer's Perspective}
        child[concept color=blue!50] { node {Lifecycle of Coding with GPT}}
        child[concept color=green!50] { node {Choosing the Right GPT}}
        child[concept color=orange!50] { node {Prompt Engineering: Principles and Techniques}}
        child[concept color=purple!50] {node {Useful Extensions and Plugins for GPT}}
        child[concept color=brown!50] { node {GPT Ecosystem}}
        child[concept color=cyan!50] {
            node[concept] (n) {Resources for Learning and Development with GPT}
        }
        child[concept color=magenta!50] {
            node[concept](o){Limitations of GPT}
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{document}
    

This code will generate a mindmap with the root node “GPT Survey: A programmer’s Perspective” and its level-1 children nodes but without any level-2 children nodes. Is there anything else you would like to know or change?

> Could you give some improvements suggestions on the color and font styles of the mindmap?

Sure! Here are some suggestions for improving the color and font styles of the mindmap:

-   You can use different shades of the same color for the level-1 and level-2 children nodes to create a more cohesive and organized look. For example, you can use a darker shade of blue for the level-1 node “Lifecycle of Coding with GPT” and lighter shades of blue for its level-2 children nodes.
    
-   You can also use contrasting colors for adjacent level-1 nodes to make them stand out more. For example, you can use complementary colors such as blue and orange or red and green for adjacent level-1 nodes.
    
-   For the font styles, you can use bold or italic fonts to emphasize certain nodes or topics. For example, you can use a bold font for the root node to make it stand out more.
    
-   You can also use different font sizes to differentiate between the levels of the mindmap. For example, you can use a larger font size for the root node and gradually decrease the font size for the lower levels.
    

These are just some suggestions to improve the visual appeal of the mindmap. You can experiment with different color and font combinations to find a style that suits your needs.

Here is an improved version of the code you provided that incorporates some of the suggestions I mentioned earlier:

    \documentclass{standalone}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{positioning}
    \usetikzlibrary{mindmap,trees}
    \usepackage{verbatim}
    
    \begin{document}
    \pagestyle{empty}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[mindmap, grow cyclic,
      every node/.style={concept},
      level 1/.append style={level distance=5cm, sibling angle=360/\the\tikznumberofchildren},
      level 2/.append style={level distance=3cm, sibling angle=45},
    ]
    
      \node[concept color=black, text=white, font=\bfseries] {GPT Survey: A programmer's Perspective}
        child[concept color=blue!70] { node {Lifecycle of Coding with GPT}}
        child[concept color=green!70] { node {Choosing the Right GPT}}
        child[concept color=orange!70] { node {Prompt Engineering: Principles and Techniques}}
        child[concept color=purple!70] {node {Useful Extensions and Plugins for GPT}}
        child[concept color=brown!70] { node {GPT Ecosystem}}
        child[concept color=cyan!70] {
            node[concept] (n) {Resources for Learning and Development with GPT}
        }
        child[concept color=magenta!70] {
            node[concept](o){Limitations of GPT}
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{document}
    

In this version of the code, I’ve made the following changes:

-   I’ve used darker shades of colors for the level-1 nodes to create a more cohesive look.
    
-   I’ve used a bold font for the root node to make it stand out more.
    

These changes should improve the visual appeal of the mindmap. You can further customize the colors and font styles to suit your needs.

Here is an improved version of the code you provided with the level-1 node titles shortened to no more than 3 words:

    \documentclass{standalone}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{positioning}
    \usetikzlibrary{mindmap,trees}
    \usepackage{verbatim}
    
    \begin{document}
    \pagestyle{empty}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[mindmap, grow cyclic,
      every node/.style={concept},
      level 1/.append style={level distance=5cm, sibling angle=360/\the\tikznumberofchildren},
      level 2/.append style={level distance=3cm, sibling angle=45},
    ]
    
      \node[concept color=black, text=white, font=\bfseries] {GPT Survey: A programmer's Perspective}
        child[concept color=blue!50] { node {Coding Lifecycle}}
        child[concept color=green!50] { node {Choosing GPT}}
        child[concept color=orange!50] { node {Prompt Engineering}}
        child[concept color=purple!50] {node {Useful Extensions}}
        child[concept color=brown!50] { node {GPT Ecosystem}}
        child[concept color=cyan!50] {
            node[concept] (n) {Learning Resources}
        }
        child[concept color=magenta!50] {
            node[concept](o){GPT Limitations}
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{document}
    

In this version of the code, I’ve shortened the titles of the level-1 nodes to no more than 3 words while still conveying the main idea of each topic. Is there anything else you would like to know or change?

> Remove the unused options and packages for this script

Here is a version of the code with the unused options and packages removed:

    \documentclass{standalone}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usetikzlibrary{mindmap}
    
    \begin{document}
    \pagestyle{empty}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[mindmap, grow cyclic,
      every node/.style={concept},
      level 1/.append style={level distance=5cm, sibling angle=360/\the\tikznumberofchildren},
    ]
    
      \node[concept color=black, text=white, font=\bfseries] {GPT Survey: A programmer's Perspective}
        child[concept color=blue!50] { node {Coding Lifecycle}}
        child[concept color=green!50] { node {Choosing GPT}}
        child[concept color=orange!50] { node {Prompt Engineering}}
        child[concept color=purple!50] {node {Useful Extensions}}
        child[concept color=brown!50] { node {GPT Ecosystem}}
        child[concept color=cyan!50] {
            node[concept] (n) {Learning Resources}
        }
        child[concept color=magenta!50] {
            node[concept](o){GPT Limitations}
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{document}
    

In this version of the code, I’ve removed the unused `positioning` and `trees` TikZ libraries as well as the unused `verbatim` package. I’ve also removed the unused `level 2` style option. This should result in a cleaner and more efficient code. Is there anything else you would like to know or change?
