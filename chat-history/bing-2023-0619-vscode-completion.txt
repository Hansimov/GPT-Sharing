I would like to add my personal completion suggestions in vscode, just like the its built-in completion for different programming languages, how could i do this?

Let me clarify my requirements. I will type some characters, and then the vscode will show a list of suggestions, and i can select one of them to complete my typing.
Then how could i add my customized word or sentence suggestions list to vscode?


Great! I create a `gpt.code-snippets` in my vscode snippets path.
Below is its initial content in json format, how could i add some of my customized snippets?
For example, I would like to enable the snippet only for `.txt` formats, then when i type "i", it would show "I would like to ...".

```json
{
	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"scope": "javascript,typescript",
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }
}
```


Great! Then I would like to make the snippets also show just besides the inline cursor when typing, how to do this?

Great! Then how to make the suggestions show immediately when typing, without pressing `Ctrl+Space`?

Then how to auto enable the action of "Trigger Suggest" without hitting `Ctrl+Space`?

Great! I have created some snippets, then how to make the completion case insensitive?
