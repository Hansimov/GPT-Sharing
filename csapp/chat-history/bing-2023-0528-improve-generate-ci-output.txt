I will provide you a Python script, please analyze the codes carefully, and then do following steps:
[1] Describe what this script does. One thing I can tell you that this script is used to generate a file structure of csvs and logs, which are used as the test data for building a website with backend and frontend.
[2] Provide the structure of generated directories and files by this script.
[2] Split the script to several parts of modules or classes, to make sure the codes inside each part are relative, and the codes outside are as independent as possible.

Here is the whole Python script:

```
```

Great! Please do following steps to the codes, step by step:
[1] Change the datetime format from `"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"` to `"%Y-%m%d-%H%M%S"`. (Do not output code in this step.)
[2] Search your knowledge base, and list several methodologies to manage a large project with multiple functions and modules.
[3] Review the listed methodologies, and provide possible changes to the codes based on these methodologies. (Also do not output code in this step.)
[4] Output the codes with changes you provided in the previous steps.
[5] Summarize above code changes to a git commit message, in the format of `[<Change_type>]: <Change_Summary>`.
[6] After finishing the steps above, recall our conversations, and then suggest four instructions related to this topic, which I might ask you to do for diving deeper and moving forward in this task.
