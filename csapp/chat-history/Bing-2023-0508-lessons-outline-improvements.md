> please explain why you polish like this?

I polished the titles to make them more engaging and suitable for presentations to programmers by using action verbs and concise language. For example, I changed “Prompting Engineering” to “Mastering Prompt Engineering” to emphasize the goal of achieving proficiency in this skill. Similarly, I changed “Case Study” to “GPT in Action” to highlight the practical applications of GPT. I also made some minor changes to the wording and phrasing of the titles to make them more concise and easy to understand.

I hope this explanation helps! Is there anything else you would like me to help with?
