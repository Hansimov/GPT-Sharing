Scenario: 
I am a experienced software engineer and I would like to share the use case of GPT in aiding programming.
I would like to make a sharing which titled "Become a Full-Stack Engineer in 1 hour".

Problem:
[1] Suggest several good cases that GPT can help software developers based on this topic.
[2] Provide the preliminaries of the topic, such as the definition of full-stack engineer, the skills required, etc.
[3] Provide the detailed steps of how to become a full-stack engineer, such as the learning path, the learning resources, etc.

Solutions:


Let's focus on a more detailed case:
[1] Users have a CI running some programs, and the program would generate some results of .log and .csv;
[2] The .log contains the running info, warnings and errors for the program and data, while the .csv contain the structured data of each test case.
[3] The user would like to quickly build a website with frontend and backend, so that he can get the notifications when the task is done, and the webpage should also contain a beautiful visualization of the history results, which is formatted from .csv files.

Please based on the above info, provide suggestions on following points:
[1] Generate testing files of .log and .csv for the frontend and backend to use;
[2] Describe the software architecture and the data flow;
[3] Recommend the framework and tools of frontend and backend, note the the learners are only familiar with Python, and has few experience on frontend development.



Great! Let's start from the first task above, which is "Generate testing files of .log and .csv for the frontend and backend to use".
Could you provide some example of the files structure and the content of the files, which are generated by the CI?
You should format the output of the structure of files in a tree view.



Please add more details to the file structure:
[1] In the child directories of each `program`, the files are organized by datetime or timestamp, in the format of `YYYY--MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` such as `2023-05-01-14-04-31`, which means the directory is created at `2023-05-01 14:04:31`.
[2] In each datetime dir, there are multiple test cases dir, such as `testcase-1`, `testcase-2`, etc. Then the logs and csvs should locate in the test case dirs.
Please re-output the tree file structure based the additional details.


Please add more details to the file structure:
[1] In the same level of `testcase` dirs, there is a `regression.csv`, which contains the difference of the results of all test cases of this run, and the differences from previous run.
[2] Make the names of files and dirs more meaningful, so that they are like the real-world cases.


Please do following improvements to the above file structure of CI output:
[1] The programs are mainly for functional and performance tests, and the test cases names should also related to this use case.
[2] Also do some other improvements based on your knowledge.
After finishing the steps above, you should suggest three questions related to this topic, which I might ask you for diving deeper in the output data generation.

Please do following improvements to the above file structure of CI output:
[1] The programs are mainly in GPU and CPU domain, so the programs names should be related to this.
[2] Also do some other improvements based on your knowledge.
After finishing the steps above, you should suggest three questions related to this topic, which I might ask you for diving deeper in the output data generation.

Great! Now let's move forward to the task of generating the test "CI_output" data.
Please based on the file structure above, generate the test data of "CI_output" in Python.
Please following the steps below:
[1] List some useful framework and libraries which are designed and suitable for this task.
[2] Describe the structure and organization of the scripts which generate these similated data in `CI_output`.
[3] After finishing the steps above, you should suggest three questions related to this topic, which I might ask you for diving deeper in the output data generation.


Please answer the following questions one by one:
[1] How can I generate more realistic data for the log and csv files?
[2] How can I simulate different types of errors and warnings in the log files?
[3] How can I generate more complex data for the regression.csv file to show differences between test runs?


Please do the following steps:
[1] Search your knowledge base, and list some useful framework and libraries which are designed and suitable for generating realistic data for the log and csv files
[2] Describe the structure and organization of the scripts which generate these simulated data in `CI_output`.
